# `D3MIRT` Modeling

The `D3mirt` analysis is based on descriptive multidimensional item response theory (DMIRT; Reckase2009, 1985; Reckase & McKinley, 1991) and can be used to analyze dichotomous and polytomous items in a multidimensional ability space.
In DMIRT analysis, also called within multidimensional modeling, it is assumed that items in a multidimensional ability space can measure single or multiple latent traits (Reckase, 2009, 1985; Reckase & McKinley, 1991).
The method is said to be descriptive because the estimates describe item characteristics when more than one latent dimension is used in the analysis.

The DMIRT approach use two types of item models, dependent on item type.
If dichotomous items are used, the analysis is based on the two-parameter logistic model (2-PL).
If polytmous items are used, the analysis is based on the two-parameter graded response model (GRM; Samejima, 1969).
In both cases, the estimation process consists of extracting two-parameter multidimensional equivalents to the unidimensional case.
For `D3mirt`, this implies that a three-dimensional 2-PL or GRM must be fitted so that discrimination and difficulty parameters for a three-dimensional latent trait model can be extracted.
Next, using these parameters the DMIRT approach makes it possible to visualize the item response functions from the GRM as vector arrows in a multidimensional space.
The `D3mirt()`function calculates all necessary estimates for this purpose, albeit limited to three dimensions.
The most central estimates, briefly explained below, in DMIRT analysis are the single multidimensional discrimination ($MDISC$) parameter and the multidimensional difficulty ($MDIFF$) index for each item.

The $MDISC$ for item $i$ represents the highest level of discrimination the item $i$ can achieve located in a multidimensional latent trait space, with $m$ number of dimensions and $a_{ik}$ item slope parameters (Reckase, 2009).

::: {align="center"}
$MDISC = A_i = \sqrt {\sum_{k = 1}^{m} a^{2}_{ik} }$
:::

Just as in unidimensional modeling, the $A_i$ indicates the slope of the item response surface at the point of maximum slope in the direction from the origin.
The slope is, similarly to the unidimensional case, assessed as $\frac{A_i}{4}$ (omitted in the equation above).

The item orientation is set by taking the direction cosines, using linear algebra terms, of $a_{il}$, i.e., the slope values of item $i$ on the coordinate axis $l$ (Reckase, 2009).

$$
a_{il}= cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a_{il}}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^m a^2_{ik}}}\right)
$$

The resulting direction vector is a characteristic of the item that describes the angular orientation of an item in a multidimensional latent trait space.

The multidimensional version of the difficulty parameter, $D_i$, for item $i$, is defined as the negative intercept $d_i$ divided by the $MDISC$ (Reckase, 2009).

$$
MDIFF=D_i=\frac{-d_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^m a^2_{ik}}}
$$

The $MDIFF$ is interpreted similarly as the difficulty parameter in the unidimensional model.
That is, higher values indicate that higher levels of ability for a probability of a correct response of more than .5 are necessary.
Moreover, the $MDIFF$, just as in the unidimensional model, sets the distance from the origin of the model to the point of maximum slope.
However, in DMIRT analysis, the $MDIFF$ becomes a multidimensional location parameter that indicates the distance from the origin to the point of maximum slope following the direction vector given by the $a_{il}$ equation.
In addition, for Likert items that hold multiple item response functions, the $MDIFF$ can, therefore, show the multidimensional range of difficulty for an item, as located in a multidimensional latent trait space.

The $MDISC$ is visualized by scaling the length of the vector arrows.
In brief, the bottom location coordinates of the vector arrows given the $MDIFF$ and $a_{il}$ are multiplied with the $MDISC$ so that items with higher $MDISC$ have longer vector arrows (Reckase, 2009).
This also implies that shorter vector arrows imply lower discrimination which in turn indicates an increased amount of model violations of the GRM.

In what follows, the `D3mirt` procedure and some of its functions and options will be described using the built-in data set "anes08_09offwaves".
The data set ($N = 1046, M_{age} = 51.33, SD = 14.56, 57\%$ Female) is a subset from the American National Election Survey (ANES) from the 2008-2009 Panel Study Off Wave Questionnaires, December 2009 (DeBell, et al, 2010; <https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2008-2009-panel-study/>).
All items measure moral preferences and are positively scored of Likert type, ranging from 1 = *Strongly Disagree* to 6 = *Strongly Agree*.
Demographic variables include age and gender (male/female).

# The `modid()` Function

The `D3mirt` analysis technique is based on the GRM extended to a three-dimensional space.
Consequently, the latter entails that `D3mirt` analysis is limited to items that fit the GRM.
However, the number of dimensions need not be exactly three, but up to three.
This since the third axis, the z-axis, is freely estimated.
But also because only two items are necessary for adequate model identification (described below).
That two items can identify the model does not, however, imply successful outcomes when using this methodology (i.e., that the model is *good*).
But it does suggest that the methodology *can* be used.

As a first step, therefore, the three-dimensional GRM must be identified (Reckase, 2009).
As just mentioned, this implies choosing two items from the scale or set with the following properties.
The first item should not load on the second and third axes ($y$ and $z$), while the second item should not load on the third axis ($z$).
If this can be empirically achieved, it will be possible to create an orthogonal structure, that is necessary for the analysis.
The `modid()` function can help with this by suggesting what items to use for this purpose.

Note, if improper items are chosen the model will be hard to interpret in a meaningful way.
Because of this, the `modid` function was developed to maximize the interpretive meaning analytically by first-order factors by the sum of squares and from this select the strongest loading items that meet the statistical assumptions described above.
This orders the model so that the strongest loading items, from the strongest factor, always align with the x-axis and that the other items follow thereon.
The model identification process is described in more detail below.

## Step 1: Explore the Data Structure

If the model is not known, the factor structure must be explored with exploratory factor analysis (EFA).
However, because `D3mirt` analysis is based on the GRM, it is recommended to use multidimensional item response theory EFA methods, such as the EFA option in `mirt::mirt` (Chalmers, 2012) with `Ã¬temtype = 'graded'`, so that the EFA is performed with the GRM as the item model.
Note, the EFA is only used to find model identification items that meet the necessary DMIRT model specification requirements.
The EFA model itself is discarded after this step in the procedure.

```{r, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# Load data
data("anes08_09offwaves")
x <- anes08_09offwaves
x <- x[,3:22] # Remove columns for age and gender

# Fit a three-factor EFA model with the mirt package
f <- mirt::mirt(x, 3, itemtype = 'graded')

# Assign data frame with factor loadings with oblimin rotation
g <- summary(f, rotate= 'oblimin')
h <- data.frame(g$rotF)
```

## Step 2: Item Selection

The `modid()` takes in the factor solution from the EFA, assigned to a data frame $x$, and outputs an $S3$ object of class `modid` containing lists of estimates.
The most important lists are the item lists, (denoted `$items`), with suggestions of what items (`item.1`...`item.n`) to use for the model identification.
The item lists have one column for the loadings from each item on the factor of interest, and one column with absolute sum scores (denoted `ABS`) for each item calculated from the remaining factor loadings in the model.
Each item list is sorted with the lowest absolute sum score highest up.
Accordingly, the top items in each list are the items that best meet the necessary statistical requirements for model identification.
Therefore, for a three-dimensional model, all else equal, the item highest up in the first list should be used to identify the x-axis, and the item highest up in the second list should be used to identify the y-axis, and so on.

```{r}
# Call to modid()
modid(h)
```

As can be seen, the first item, that will be used set the x-axis, is found in the first list, `items[[1]]` and `item.1`.
In this case the best item for the x-axis is "W7Q3".
The item that identifies the y-axis is found in the next list, `items[[2]]` and `Item.2`.
In this case, the best item for the y-axis is "W7Q20".

Sometimes, however, the model is harder to identify.
If this happens, the first option is to change the rotation method in the EFA, e.g., to change from *oblimin* to *varimax*.
If this does not solve the issue, the user can try adjusting the `upper` and `lower` bound in `modid()`.
The latter argument, however, should only be used as a last resort.
This is because the upper bound sets the upper limit for inclusion.
Adjusting this limit too high means that the necessary statistical requirements are compromised.
The lower limit, however, only increases the size of the item pool used for the item selection.
The user is, therefore, recommended to adjust the lower limit up and down to see if the output differs, and from that make the final decision on what items to use.

```{r}
# Call to modid with increased lower and higher bound
modid(h, lower = 1, upper = .12 )
```

In this case, the same items are suggested even after adjusting both the `lower` and `upper` limits.

Another option, if the analysis runs into problems, is to override the factor order with the `fac.order` argument.
More specifically, `modid` orders factor by squared factor loadings so that the strongest factor is used first, the second strongest factor is used second, and so on.
Sometimes, however, there is only a very small difference between the squared factor loadings.
In such situations, it can be useful to rearrange the factor order manually to see if the model solution changes (foremost observable when plotting).

```{r}
# Override factor order by reversing columns in the original data frame
modid(h, fac.order = c(3,2,1))
```

In this case, we find the item that was previously suggested for the y-axis, to be suggested for the x-axis.
For the y-axis, however, we now find a new item, "W7Q13", to identify the y-axis.
Since the squared factor loadings for factors 2 and 3 are quite similar, it can be useful to try this suggestion as well and then compare the results.

## The Model Identification Procedure

Some details on the `modid()` function and its algorithm should be given.
The function uses an iterating procedure that can be user adjusted.
In brief, in the default automatic mode, `modid()` starts by first calculating the sum of squares loadings on all factors $F$ in the data frame $x$ and then rearrange the columns in $x$, in decreasing order following the level of strength of the sum of squares loadings.
Next, the function creates a list containing factor loadings on the first factor, $f_1$, and absolute sum scores of the factor loadings in the remaining factors, i.e., $F-f_1$, row-wise.
The list is then rearranged in decreasing order based on factor loading strength on $f_1$.
Items are selected by scaling $f_1$, and then using a standard deviation of $0.5$ (which can be adjusted with the `lower` argument.) as the lower bound criteria for inclusion in the item pool.
That is, starting from the top, rows with raw factor scores and absolute sum scores are extracted until the lower bound is reached.
This allows the function to extract more rows in the case empirical factor loadings are very similar in strength.
The result is recorded as a nested list before the function starts over with the next factor, $f_2$, and so on.

For every iteration, the algorithm jumps to the next factor in the EFA model, rearranges rows, and extracts the strongest loading items.
However the absolute sum score is always assessed on the number of factors less than the total number of factors following the order of iteration, That is, iteration $1$ use factor loadings from all factors $F-f_1$, iteration $F-(f_{1-2})$, iteration $3$ $F-(f_{1-3})$, and so on, when calculating the absolute sum scores.

### Criteria For Model Identification

Optimized model identification items should preferably (a) have an absolute sum score of $\leq .10$ and (b) with maximized factor loading on the factor of interest.
Of these two criteria, (a) should be given the strongest weight in the selection decision.
If these conditions cannot be met, the user is advised to proceed with caution since the loading scores imply that an adequate orthogonal structure may not be empirically attainable.
If problems in the model identification process occur, please follow the advice given above.

### Limitations

The `modid()` function is not limited to three-dimensional analysis and can be used on any number of factors.
Although based on suggestions on model identification given by Reckase (2009) for this type of analysis, the function offers some expansions that introduce more precision.
The latter foremost consists in incorporating the sum of squares in the item selection process (unless the user has not specified otherwise).
Experience tells us that this is good practice that often leads to better results compared to other options.
However, it is important to recognize that the model identification procedure only gives suggestions to the model specification, and there could be situations where the researcher should consider other methods.

# The `D3mirt()` Function

The `D3mirt()` function takes in a data frame with model parameters from a three-dimensional GRM model, specified with orthogonal factors, and set so that all items load on all factors (see examples below).
The function then returns an $S3$ object of class `D3mirt` with lists of $a$ and $d$ parameters from the GRM, as well as $MDISC$, $MDIFF$, direction cosines, and degrees for vector angles, construct lists, and vector coordinates assessed by `D3mirt()`.

The three-dimensional GRM estimation is preferably done with the `mirt::mirt` (Chalmers, 2012) function.
Please note very carefully how the GRM model is specified in the example below.

```{r, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# Load data
data("anes08_09offwaves")
x <- anes08_09offwaves
x <- x[,3:22] # Remove columns for age and gender

# Fit a three-dimensional graded response model with orthogonal factors
# Example below uses Likert items from the built in data set "anes08_09offwaves"
# Item W7Q3 and item W7Q20 was selected with `modid()`
# The model specification set all items in the data set (1-20) 
# to load on all three factors (F1-F3)
# The START and FIXED commands are used on the two items to identify the DMIRT model
 spec <- ' F1 = 1-20
           F2 = 1-20
           F3 = 1-20

           START=(W7Q3,a2,0)
           START=(W7Q3,a3,0)

           START=(W7Q20,a3,0)

           FIXED=(W7Q3,a2)
           FIXED=(W7Q3,a3)

           FIXED=(W7Q20,a3) '


mod1 <- mirt::mirt(x, 
                   spec, 
                   itemtype = 'graded', 
                   SE = TRUE, 
                   method = 'QMCEM')

# Assign a data frame with factor loadings (located in the first three columns in mod1),
# and difficulty parameters (columns 4-8 in mod1) with mirt::coef and $'items'[,1:8]))
d <- data.frame(mirt::coef(mod1, 
                           simplify=TRUE)$'items'[,1:8])
```

The `D3mirt()` function call is straightforward.
The output, however, is lengthy so it is recommended to use the summary function when inspecting the results.

```{r}
# Call D3mirt() with data frame d
g <- D3mirt(d)
summary(g) # Show summary of results
```

As can be seen, the summary function gives starts with presenting the number of difficulty levels (and items in constructs; see below) a short statements on the number of items and difficulty levels.
Next, lists of estimates are shown.
Of these, foremost the $a_{1-3}$, $MDISC$, $MDIFF_{d1-dn}$, and $xÂ°, \, yÂ°, \, zÂ°$ should be reported in a study.

## Constructs

The user has the option of including constructs in the estimation, by creating one or more nested lists that indicate what items belong to what construct.
From this, the `D3mirt()` function calculates direction cosines for the constructs by adding and normalizing the direction cosines for the items contained in each construct list.
The length of the vector arrows is arbitrary and can be user adjusted.
The construct vector arrows can contribute to the analysis by (a) visualizing the average direction for a subset set of items, and (b) showing how combinations of items interrelate on group-level in the model, i.e., as a type of dimensionality analysis.
Examples of the utility of using constructs will be given in the short analysis example presented below.

```{r}
# Call to D3mirt(), including optional nested lists for three constructs
# Item W7Q16 is not included in any construct because of model violations
# The model violations for the item can be seen when plotting the model
c <- list(list (1,2,3,4), 
          list(5,7,8,9,10), 
          list(11,12,13,14,15,15,16,17,18,19,20))
g <- D3mirt(d, c)
summary(g)
```

Compared to the previous function call to `D3mirt()`, we now see an extra list (`$construct.angles`) with direction cosines and angles for the constructs.

# The `plotD3mirt` Function

The `plotD3mirt` function is based on the `rgl` package (Adler & Murdoch, 2023) for visualization with OpenGL.
The output consists of a three-dimensional interactive RGL device displaying vector arrows with the latent dimensions running along the orthogonal axes centered at zero.
If polytomous items are used each item will have multiple arrows, representing each item response function, that run successively along the same angle in the model.

## Unidimensionality vs. Within-Dimensionality

In DMIRT (Reckase, 2009, 1985, Reckase & McKinley, 1991), the angle of the vector arrows, seen from the model axes, indicates the direction of the maximal slope of discrimination for the particular item response function.
In turn, this indicates what traits, located along the orthogonal axes, an item can be said to describe.
For instance, an item located at $0Â°$ seen from the x-axis, and $90Â°$ as seen from the $y$ and z-axis, only describes trait $x$.
Such an item is unidimensional because its direction vector of maximal discrimination slope lies parallel and on the x-axis.
In contrast, an item located at $45Â°$ between all three axes in a three-dimensional model describes all three traits in the model equally well.
Such an item is within-multidimensional with respect to all three latent traits used in the analysis because its direction vector points in the $45Â°$ direction in the model.

## Model Violations of the GRM

When plotting the `D3mirt` model with `plotD3mirt()` it is possible to visually observe violations of GRM in the graphical device returned.
For instance, shorter vector arrows indicate weaker discrimination and therefore also higher amounts of model violations in comparison.
Moreover, if an item struggles or even fail to describe any of the latent variables in the model, it can often lead to an extreme stretch of the $MDIFF$ range.
This is comparable to trace lines turning horizontal in a unidimensional item response theory model.
Examples of model violations and within-dimensionality will be given below.

## Illustration: An Item and Dimensionality Analysis

To illustrate the utility of `D3mirt` visualization, a short example using the `anes08_09offwaves` data set will be presented.
Graphing in default mode by calling `plotd3mirt` will return an RGL device that will appear in an external window as a three-dimensional object that can be rotated.
In this illustration, however, all RGL devices are shown inline, as interactive objects that can be rotated.
The `view` argument is also used in all function calls to `plotD3mirt` below.
This was only done for optimizing the size of the RGL device (default `view = c(15, 20, 7)`) when creating this R Markdown vingette.

```{r, testg1, webgl = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# Plot RGL device
plotD3mirt(g, view = c(15, 20, 0.6))
```

An example of how the output can be described could be the following.

> "As can be seen, Figure X indicates the presence of foremost two latent dimensions, one aligned with the x-axis and one approaching the y-axis. The two dimensions, however, have some within-multidimensional tendencies since they are not completely orthogonal. This tendency is much more prominent for the items W7Q11, W7Q12, W7Q13, and W7Q14, being located at around the $45Â°$ angle or higher between the x and z-axis.

The graphical device indicates the presence of foremost two latent dimensions, one aligned with the x-axis and one approaching the y-axis.
The two dimensions, however, have some within-multidimensional tendencies since they are not completely orthogonal.
This tendency, however, is much more prominent for the items W7Q11, W7Q12, W7Q13, and W7Q14 since they are located at around the $45Â°$ angle or higher between the x and z-axis.

To get a better understanding of the interrelation of the dimensions, constructs can be added to asses the average angle when grouping items.
In this example, items have been grouped based on their location in the model space.
However, the grouping of items can be exploratory, as in this case, or based on theory.
Note, item W7Q16 was not included in any of the constructs because of high model violation tendencies and notable within-multidimensionality.

To plot constructs, change the set `constructs = TRUE`.
The constructs are named with strings as input to the `construct.lab` argument.
In this example construct labels were chosen based on theory and reading of item content.

```{r, testg3, webgl=TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# Plot RGL device with constructs visible and named
plotD3mirt(g, 
           constructs = TRUE, 
           construct.lab = c("Fairness", "Conformity", "Compassion"), 
           view = c(15, 20, 0.6))
```

An example of how the output can be described could be as follows.

> The output in Figure $X$ visualizes the average direction of the item vectors.
> Moreover, the angles of the construct vectors inform us of how these groups of items are associated.
> In this example, we find Compassion ($xÂ° = 3.91, yÂ° = 86.49, zÂ° = 88.29$) and Conformity ($xÂ° = 61.84, yÂ° = 28.19, zÂ° = 91.19$) with some within-multidimensional tendencies.
> However, they are both more or less orthogonal to the z-axis.
> Next, we find Fairness ($xÂ° = 50.13, yÂ° = 78.31, zÂ° = 42.25$) with clear within-multidimensional tendencies with respect to the x and z-axis.
> Thus, Fairness, in this model, does not seem to be an independent construct.

Moreover, the angles of the construct vectors inform us of how these groups of items are associated.
In this example, we find Compassion ($xÂ° = 3.91, yÂ° = 86.49, zÂ° = 88.29$) and Conformity ($xÂ° = 61.84, yÂ° = 28.19, zÂ° = 91.19$) with some within-multidimensional tendencies.
However, they are both more or less orthogonal to the z-axis.
Next, we find Fairness ($xÂ° = 50.13, yÂ° = 78.31, zÂ° = 42.25$) with clear within-multidimensional tendencies with respect to the x and z-axis.
Thus, Fairness, in this model, does not seem to be an independent construct.

As was mentioned above, the W7Q16 had the most measurement problems of all items in the data.
More specifically, the short vector arrows indicate high amounts of model violations.
Moreover, the location of the item in the model also indicates that the item is within-multidimensional and that it does not seem to belong to any construct explicitly.

The `plotD3mirt` allows us to plot the item alone using argument `items` and entering the number indicating where the item appears in the data set (see `?anes08_09offwaves`).

```{r, testg4, webgl=TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# Item W7Q16 has location 6 in the data set (gender and age excluded)
# The item is plotted together with construct to aid the visual interpretation
plotD3mirt(g, 
           constructs = TRUE, 
           items = 6, 
           construct.lab = c("Fairness", "Conformity", "Compassion"), 
           view = c(15, 20, 0.6))
```

An example of how the output can be described could be as follows.

> Figure $X$ indicates the presence of foremost two latent dimensions, one aligned with the x-axis and one approaching the y-axis.
> The two dimensions, however, have some within-multidimensional tendencies since they are not completely orthogonal.

> However, both more or less orthogonal to the z-axis.

## Other Graphical Options

### `diff.level`

The user has the option of plotting the model on one level of difficulty at a time with the `diff.level` argument on the entire scale or one item at a time.
Note, difficulty is the number of response functions, i.e., the number of response options $-1$.
In this case, $6$ options were used which means that the model has $5$ levels of difficulty.

```{r, testg5, webgl = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# Plot RGL device on one level of difficulty
plotD3mirt(g, 
           diff.level = 5, 
           view = c(15, 20, 0.6))
```

### `items`

A subset of items can be plotted for a more thorough investigation.
In the example below constructs are kept which can help with the visual interpretation of the item subset.
Items are selected, just as in the single case, based on the order in the data frame (see `?anes08_09offwaves`)

```{r, testg6, webgl=TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# A selection of Conformity items from the model plotted with constructs
plotD3mirt(g, 
           constructs = TRUE, 
           items = c(5,7,8,9,10), 
           construct.lab = c("Fairness", "Conformity", "Compassion"), 
           view = c(15, 20, 0.6))
```

### `scale`

The `D3mirt()` function returns vector coordinates estimated with and without the $MDISC$ as a scalar for the arrow length.
When the $MDISC$ is not used for the arrow length, all vector arrows are scaled to one unit length.
This allows the user to graph the vector arrows with `plotD3mirt()` set to equal length, or more specifically, scaled to one unit length.
This can help reduce clutter in the graphical output when using `plotD3mirt()`.

```{r, testg7, webgl=TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# Plot RGL device with scaled items and constructs visible and named
plotD3mirt(g, 
           scale = TRUE, 
           constructs = TRUE, 
           construct.lab = c("Fairness", "Conformity", "Compassion"), 
           view = c(15, 20, 0.6))
```

# `D3mirt` Profile Analysis

The `plotD3mirt()` function can also display respondent scores in the three-dimensional model represented as spheres located with the help of factors scores used as coordinates.
This allows for a profile analysis in which respondent rows are selected conditioned on some external criteria and then plotted.
The resulting output shows where the respondent are located in the model.

This can be described by dividing the model into octants, $O_{1-8}$, and then seeing what octants the respondents in question tend to occupy.
For example, if more respondents, conditioned on some external variable, are located within one particular octant, $O_n$, this indicates that the respondents tend to have the latent profile that $O_n$ describes in the model.
For example, we might find a certain selection of respondents best described by $O_7$; high levels on trait on $x$ (above center on the x-axis), low on trait $y$ (below center on the y-axis), and high on trait $z$ (above center on the z-axis).
And so on.

To do this, the user must first extract respondent factor scores with `mirt::fscores` (Chalmers, 2012) and then select a subset of respondent rows.
The resulting data frame is imputed in the `profiles` argument.
Generally, it can be useful to hide vector arrows with `hide = TRUE` when analyzing respondent profiles to avoid visual cluttering.
The example below select respondent scores by separating on the gender variable

```{r}
# Extract respondent factor scores from mod1 with fscores() function from [mirt::mirt]
f <- mirt::fscores(mod1, 
                   method="EAP", 
                   full.scores = TRUE, 
                   full.scores.SE = F, QMC = T)

# Attach f to gender variable (column 2 from anes08_09offwaves data set; "W3XGENDER")
# Use cbind with fscores() output first
data("anes08_09offwaves")
x <- anes08_09offwaves
z <- data.frame(cbind(f, x[,2]))
```

Call `plotD3mirt` with the respondent data frame in the `profiles` argument and the `levels` argument with the levels column subsetted from $z$.

The `plotD3mirt`function uses `as.factor()` to count the number of factor levels in the data imputed in the `levels` argument.
This means that raw data can be used but the number of colors in the color vectors argument (`sphere.col`) may need to be adapted.
In the example below, the criteria variable for gender only hold two factor levels.
Therefore only two colors in the color vector are needed.
The three axes have also been named in the function call below.

```{r, testg8, webgl=TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# Plot profiles with item vector arrows hidden
# Score levels: 1 = Blue ("male") and 2 = Red ("female")
plotD3mirt(g, hide = TRUE, 
           profiles = z, 
           levels = z[,4], 
           sphere.col = c("blue", "red"), 
           x.lab = "Compassion", 
           y.lab="Conformity", 
           z.lab="Fairness", 
           view = c(15, 20, 0.6))
```

An example of how the output can be described could be as follows.

> In the graphical output, it can be observed a simple profile on gender in which more women tend to have higher levels of trait on compassion ($O_{1, 2, 5, 6}$).
> There seems not to be any observable gender difference related to Conformity or Fairness.

The use of `rep()` function makes it possible to create groups based on factor levels.
This can be useful when a criterion variable has a wide data range, such as an age variable.
More specifically, a color vector can be created with colors repeated by `rep()` and then be imputed in the `sphere.col` argument.
When plotting, the `plotD3mirt()` function will pick colors following the factor order in the `levels` argument.
This example compares respondents 30 years or younger against 70 years or older.
To count the number of factor levels in raw data, the `nlevels(as.factor(x))` call can be used to set the length of the color vector in `sphere.col`.

```{r}
# Column bind fscores() with age variable ("W3Xage")
y <- data.frame(cbind(f, x[,1]))

# Subset data frame y conditioned on age <= 30
z1 <- subset(y, y[,4] <= 30)

# Subset data frame y conditioned on age >= 70
z2 <- subset(y, y[,4] >= 70)

# Row bind z1 and z2
z <- rbind(z1,z2)

# Check number of factor levels with nlevels() and as.factor()
nlevels(as.factor(z1[,4]))
nlevels(as.factor(z2[,4]))

# Use rep() to create a color vector to color groups based on the nlevels() output
# z1 has 14 factor levels and z2 has 16 factor levels
# z1 respondents are colored red and z2 are colored blue
colvec <- c(rep("red", 14), 
            rep("blue", 16))
```

```{r, testg9, webgl=TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# Call plotD3mirt with profile data on age with item vector arrows hidden
plotD3mirt(g, hide = TRUE, 
           profiles = z, 
           levels = z[,4], 
           sphere.col = colvec, 
           x.lab = "Compassion", 
           y.lab="Conformity", 
           z.lab="Fairness", 
           view = c(15, 20, 0.6))
```

An example of how the output can be described could be as follows.

> As can be seen, Figure $X$ indicates an age effect in which older individuals have higher levels of trait on Conformity.
> Rotating the model to the left also shows that older individuals may have slightly higher levels of Fairness, even if the effect is less clear.
> There does not seem to be any difference in Compassion, however.
> To sum, we can say, therefore, that the analysis indicates a possibility that older individuals may have a moral profile consisting of high Conformity and high Fairness ($O_{1, 4}$).

It is also possible to plot a confidence interval in the shape of an ellipse surrounding the individual scores.
In the example below, the younger individuals ($â¤30$) are plotted together with a $95\%$ *CI*.

```{r}
# Column bind fscores() with age variable ("W3Xage")
y <- data.frame(cbind(f, x[,1]))

# Subset data frame y conditioned on age <= 30
z1 <- subset(y, y[,4] <= 30)

# Use rep() to create a color vector to color groups based on the nlevels() output
# z1 has 14 factor levels
colvec <- c(rep("red", 14))
```

As can be seen below, to plot the *CI*, the `ellipse` argument is set to `TRUE`.
The color of the sphere was also changed from default `grey80` to `orange`.
Note, the *CI* limit can be adjusted with the `CI.level` argument.

```{r, testg10, webgl=TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# Call plotD3mirt with profile data on age with item vector arrows hidden
plotD3mirt(g, hide = TRUE, 
           profiles = z1, 
           levels = z1[,4], 
           sphere.col = colvec, 
           x.lab = "Compassion", 
           y.lab="Conformity", 
           z.lab="Fairness", 
           ellipse = TRUE, 
           CI.level = 0.95, 
           ellipse.col = "orange",
           view = c(15, 20, 0.6))
```

In the output, it can be observed that the $95\%$ *CI* highlights the younger respondents' lower levels of conformity in the model.

# Exporting The RGL Device

Some options for exporting the RGL device are shown below.
Over and above these, it is also possible to export graphical devices in R Markdown documents with `rgl::hookwebgl()` together with graphical options for knitr, as was done in this vignette.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Export an open RGL device to the console to be saved as html or image file
plotD3mirt(g, 
           constructs = TRUE)
s <- scene3d()
rgl::rglwidget(s, 
               width = 1040, 
               height = 1040)

# Store widget directly to file
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(rglwidget(s, 
                        width = 1040, height = 1040), 
                        file = "anes08_09offwaves.html", 
                        libdir = "libs", 
                        selfcontained = FALSE)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Export a snap shoot of an open RGL device directly to file
plotD3mirt(g, 
           constructs = TRUE)
rgl::snapshot3d('RGLdevice.png', 
                    fmt = 'png')
```
