\value{
A RGL graphical device.
}
\description{
For graphing of objects of class \code{D3mirt} from the \code{\link[=D3mirt]{D3mirt()}} function.
}
\details{
The function is based on the \link{rgl} package for visualization with OpenGL. outputs a three-dimensional interactive RGL device containing the descriptive multidimensional item response theory model with orthogonal standardized axes centered at 0.
An open RGL device can be exported to the R console interactive html file or as a still shoots (see examples below).
In the case of the latter, the model perspective in the still shoot can be manually adjusted or adjusted by changing the \code{view} argument for the function.
}
\section{Plotting options}{
The function allows plotting of all items, a selection of items as well as plotting a single item (see examples section).
Items can also be plotted with unit length by setting \code{scale = TRUE}.
In addition, the user also has the option of adding constructs to the graphical output with \code{constructs = TRUE} (see the documentation for \link{D3mirt} regarding constructs).
Plotting can be limited to showing one level of difficulty with the \code{diff.level} argument at a time if multiple levels of difficulty are used in the model.
Item names are displayed by default, but the user has the option of imputing new names for the items (with \code{item.lab}) and adding names for the constructs (with \code{construct.lab}).
}

\section{Visual Profile Analysis}{
In addition, the plot function can also display respondent scores in the model space, represented as spheres located with the help of factors scores as coordinates in the model.
This allows for a type of profile analysis of respondent groups in which respondents' are selected and displayed based on some external criteria (see examples section below).
To do this, the user must first extract respondent factor scores with \link[mirt:fscores]{mirt::fscores}(Chalmers, 2012) and then use some selection process to subset respondent rows.
The resulting data frame is imputed in the \code{profiles} argument.
A general advice is also to hiding vector arrows with \code{hide = TRUE} when analyzing respondent profiles to avoid visual cluttering.
}

\section{Guidelines for Interpreting the Graphical Output}{
In general, vector arrows represent item response functions and the location, angle, and length of the arrows indicate item characteristics (Reckase, 2009).
If polytomous items, such as Likert items, are used then each an item will have multiple item response functions that run successively long the same line.

The angle of the vector arrows, seen from the model axes, indicates the direction of maximal slope of discrimination for the particular item response function.
In turn, this also indicates what singular traits, located along the orthogonal axes, an item can be said to describe.
For instance, an item located at 0Â° seen from x-axis, and 90Â° as seen from the y and z-axis, only describes trait x.
Such an item is unidimensional because its direction vector of maximal discrimination slope lies parallel and on the x-axis.
In contrast, an item located at 45Â° between all three axes in a three-dimensional model describes all three traits in the model equally well.
Such an item is within-multidimensional because its direction vector lies parallel and on the 45Â° degree line.

The distance of the lower end of the vector arrows away from the origin indicates the an items multidimensional difficulty (MDIFF).
For Likert items that hold multiple item response functions, the MDIFF can, therefore, be said to show the multidimensional range of difficulty for an item.

The length of the arrow indicates the item's level of multidimensional discrimination (MDISC).
Longer arrows indicates high discrimination and shorter arrows indicates lower discrimination.
}

\section{Model Violations}{
Since descriptive multidimensional item response theory is based on the multidimensional version of the graded response model(Samejima, 1969),
all items must adequately meet the necessary statistical assumptions of this type of item model.
In \code{D3mirt} analysis, this implies that violations of graded response model can be observed visually in the \code{plotD3mirt()} graphical device.
For instance, shorter vector arrows indicate weaker discrimination and therefore also higher amounts of model violations in comparison.
Moreover, if an item struggles or even fail to describe any of the latent variables in the model, it can be observed as an extreme stretch of the MDIFF range.
This is comparable to observing trace lines turning horizontal in a unidimensional item response theory model.
