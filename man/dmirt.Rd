\title{dmirt: Estimation of the D3mirt S3 Object}
\usage{
dmirt(x, constructs = NULL, max.norm = 1.1, min.norm = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame or matrix}

\item{constructs}{Nested list or lists with integers indicating what items are part of what construct. Default is NULL.}

\item{max.norm}{Scaling factor for the length of the construct arrow above center in the model. Default is set to 1.1.}

\item{min.norm}{Scaling factor for the length of the construct arrow below center in the model. Default is set to 0.6.}
}
\value{
S3 object that contain lists with estimates.
}
\description{
The \code{dmirt()}function creates an S3 object that contains all necessary estimates for the three dimensional measurement model.
}
\details{
Input consists of a data frame that holds factor loadings and difficulty parameters for all items in the scale or set. Importantly, rows must be items and number of columns must be â‰¥ 4, i.e., three columns for factor loadings and at least one column for item difficulty. The vector arrows that can be plotted with the \code{plot()} function represents item characteristics the three dimensional theta space. More specifically, item location shows the items three dimensional level of difficulty. If Likert items are used, each item will have multiple level of difficulty and can therefore be said to show the difficulty range of an item. Moreover, the angle of the vector arrows shows the direction of optimal discrimination in the model. In turn, this indicates what traits, one up to three, the item can be said to describe. Lastly, the length of each vector arrows shows the strength of discrimination, in which longer arrows indicate higher discrimination. Short vector arrows are therefore signs of model violations. The user has the option of including constructs in the estimation, by creating one or more nested lists that states what items belongs to what construct (see the examples section). From this, the \code{dmirt()}function extract direction vectors by averaging the direction cosines for the items contained in each construct list. The constructs vector arrows, therefore, can contribute by visualizing the average direction for at larger set of items. However, the length of the construct arrow has no meaning and can be set by the user by changing the \code{max.norm} and \code{min.norm} arguments.
