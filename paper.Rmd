# Summary
The `D3mirt` package for `R` [@R] offers functions for analyzing questionnaire items used in psychological research in a three-dimensional latent space. The application is based on descriptive multidimensional item response theory (DMIRT) [@Reckase:2009; @Reckase:1985; @Reckase+McKinley:1991], a statistical framework incorporating vector geometry to describe item characteristics. The method is foremost visual, and the latent model can be plotted as an interactive graphical device with the help of a dedicated plot function based on the `RGL` 3D visualization device system for `R` [@Adler+Murdoch:2023]. Alongside the plot function, the package also includes a model identification function that helps the user identify the DMIRT model and a model estimation function for extracting the necessary vector estimates. New additions to the DMIRT framework introduced in the `D3mirt` package include studying constructs (explained below) and individual scores plotted in the three-dimensional latent model.

# Statement of need

Common to most item response theory (IRT) models is the assumption of *unidimensionality*, i.e., that a test or item measures simple structures [@Hambleton+Jones+Rogers:1991]. There are, however,
many occasions where this may be improper. Consider a mathematical word problem
[@Reckase:2009; @Reckase:1985; @Reckase+McKinley:1991].
To solve a mathematical word problem, one must often have verbal and mathematical skills, referred to as abilities (denoted $\theta$) in the literature on IRT.
In other words, one's resulting answer would be a function based on one's ability to read, on the one hand, and one's ability to perform numerical manipulations, on the other. Accordingly, instead of a person's location on a unidimensional 
latent variable, the mathematical word problem illustrates a situation where it seems more 
reasonable to assume that a correct response is due to the respondent's location in a 
multidimensional latent space. 

Descriptive multidimensional item response theory (DMIRT) [@Reckase:2009; @Reckase:1985; @Reckase+McKinley:1991] was developed to handle the just mentioned situation. The method is based on using a *compensatory model*, 
i.e., a type of measurement model in multidimensional IRT that uses linear combinations of $\theta$-values for ability assessment. This model assumes that the same probability score for a correct response can be reached by using different combinations of $\theta$-values, as opposed to assuming that the relation is one-to-one. In turn, this implies that the compensatory model allows items to be unidimensional, i.e., that they measure a single ability, or *within-multidimensional*, i.e., that the items can measure more than one ability in the model space.

Note that the `D3mirt` approach is limited to two types of compensatory models, depending on item type.
If dichotomous items are used, the analysis is based on the multidimensional extension of the two-parameter logistic model [@McKinley+Reckase:1983] as the compensatory model. If polytomous items are used, the analysis is based on the two-parameter multidimensional graded response model [@Muraki+Carlson:1995] as the compensatory model.

Compared to other software, `D3mirt` is unique in implementing DMIRT methodology explicitly and comprehensively in a three-dimensional interactive environment. For instance, a compensatory model can be fitted with software dedicated to multidimensional IRT that supports dichotomous or polytomous data and allows the user to specify the necessary factor structure. This includes software such as `Mplus` [@MPLUS] or `IRTPRO 2.1` [@IRTPRO] and `flexMIRT` [@flexMIRT] for the Windows environment. Using these software programs, the DMIRT estimates can then be derived manually with the help of general mathematical software, such as `MATLAB` [@MATLAB] or `Mathematica` [@Mathematica], and plotted with built-in options for creating vector plots in two or three dimensions. This is, however, often time-consuming, and the plotting methods are not optimized for DMIRT analysis and test development. Regarding `R`, the `mirt` package [@Chalmers:2012] can be used to fit the compensatory multidimensional model and derive the basic DMIRT item and person parameters while the vector plot options are limited. There is also the `R` package `plink` [@Weeks:2010] that offers two-dimensional vector plots suitable for DMIRT analysis but only for dichotomous items. Another more general limitation is that none of the formerly mentioned software applications provides a function to help identify the DMIRT model. 

The `D3mirt` package was designed to counter many of the just mentioned shortages by implementing specialized functions for identifying the DMIRT model, calculation of the necessary DMIRT estimates, and plotting the results in an interactive three-dimensional latent environment (see \autoref{fig:anes}). An example of the utility of using the package in an empirical context for item and scale analysis has been presented in @Forsberg:2024.

# Multidimensional item parameters

The theoretical framework for DMIRT rests foremost on three assumptions [@Reckase:1985]. Firstly, ability maps the probability monotonically, such that a higher level of ability implies a higher probability of answering an item correctly. Second, we wish to locate an item at a singular point at which it is possible to derive item characteristics for the multidimensional case conceptually similar to the unidimensional case. Thirdly, an item's maximum level of discrimination, i.e., its highest possible capacity to separate respondents on level of ability, is the best option for the singular point estimation. The most important parameter equations regarding the assumptions just mentioned will be briefly presented below.

Firstly, by using the discrimination score $a_i$ on item $i$ from the compensatory model, we can define the multidimensional discrimination index (MDISC) as follows. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:MDISC}
MDISC := \sqrt {\sum_{k = 1}^{m} a^{2}_{ik}},
\end{equation}

on $m$ dimensions with the slope constant $\frac{1}{4}$ omitted [@Reckase:2009; @Reckase+McKinley:1991]. The MDISC is sometimes denoted $A_i$ to highlight the connection to the unidimensional $a_i$ parameter [@Reckase:2009; @Reckase+McKinley:1991]. Importantly, the MDISC sets the orientation of the item vectors in the multidimensional space [@Reckase:2009; @Reckase+McKinley:1991].

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:dcos}
\omega_{il} = cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a_{il}}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^m a^2_{ik}}}\right),
\end{equation}

on latent axis $l$ in the model. Note, the $\omega_{il}$ is in this solution a characteristic of the item $i$ that tells in what direction $i$ has its highest level of discrimination, assuming a multidimensional latent space [@Reckase:2009; @Reckase+McKinley:1991]. This gives us the following criteria to use as a rule of thumb. Assume a two-dimensional space, an orientation of $0^{\circ}$ with respect to any of the model axes indicates that the item is unidimensional. Such an item describes a singular trait only. In contrast, an orientation of $45^{\circ}$ indicated that the item is within-multidimensional. Such an item describes both traits in the two-dimensional model equally well. The same criteria are extended to the three-dimensional case. The MDISC is also used in the graphical output to scale the length of the vector arrows representing the item response functions, e.g., so that longer vector arrows indicate higher discrimination, shorter arrows lower discrimination in the model, and so on.

Next, to assess multidimensional difficulty, the distance from the origin is calculated using the multidimensional difficulty (MDIFF), denoted $B_i$ to highlight the connection to the unidimensional $b_i$ parameter [@Reckase:1985].

\begin{equation} \label{eq:MDIFF}
MDIFF :=\frac{-d_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^m a^2_{ik}}},
\end{equation}

in which $d_i$ is the $d_i$-parameter from the compensatory model. The MDIFF is, therefore, a difficulty characteristic of item $i$, such that higher MDIFF values indicate that higher levels of ability are necessary for a correct response [@Reckase:2009;  @Reckase+McKinley:1991]. Observe that the denominator in \autoref{eq:MDIFF} is the same expression as \autoref{eq:MDISC}. 

Importantly, in DMIRT analysis, the MDISC and MDIFF only apply in the direction set by $\omega_{il}$ and \autoref{eq:dcos} [@Reckase:2009; @Reckase+McKinley:1991]. Thus, we cannot compare these estimates directly across items, as would be the case in the unidimensional model. This is because DMIRT seeks to maximize item discrimination as a global characteristic in a multidimensional environment. To estimate item discrimination as a local characteristic in the multidimensional space, it is, however, possible to select a common direction for the items and then recalculate the discrimination, i.e., to estimate the directional discrimination (DDISC), as follows.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:DDISC}
DDISC :=\sum_{k=1}^{m}a_{ik}cos\,\omega_{ik}.
\end{equation}

Since the DDISC is a local characteristic in the model, it is always the case that $DDISC\,\leq\,MDISC$. In `D3mirt`, the DDISC is optional and implemented in `D3mirt` as optional *construct vectors* indicated by a subset of items or using spherical coordinates. 

The results include tables for the MDISC and MDIFF estimates as well as spherical coordinates describing the location of the vector arrows. If construct vectors are used, the output also includes DDISC scores for all items showing the constrained discrimination. It is also possible to plot individual scores (i.e., *profile analysis*) in the three-dimensional latent space (see \autoref{fig:p1}). This can be useful for studying respondents' location conditioned on some external variable, e.g., sex, age, political preference, and so on. Instructions on the method, such as model identification, model estimation, plotting, and profile analysis, are given in the package vignette.
